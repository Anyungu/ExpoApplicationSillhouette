How I start my Expo projects

Modules I like starting with:
	
	"react-native-router-flux" >> Routing
	"react-native-vector-icons" >> Icons
	"react-redux" >> state management
	"redux" >> State management
	"redux-thunk" >> State management

How to Use:
	
	1. expo init >> To start your expo project
	2. npm i react-native-router-flux >> To install the modules
	3. install the rest of the modules
	4. git clone https://github.com/Anyungu/ExpoApplicationSillhouette.git to a different folder
	5. Replace the App.js file with the App.js file from your clone folder
	6. Add the rest of the files in the root of your project folder

Caution: Do not USE this method if you do not understand Redux
